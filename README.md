# shortest_path
This application implements Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to find the fast route between any two stations or nodes.

code
The jupyter cells are made up of a couple of tkinter codes. Tkinter is a known graphic 
interface library for python.

Once you run the cells, an interface should pop up.

The interface is would show two drop-downs; one indicating starting location and the other;
destination.

Below the drop-downs would be a listbox where one can select stations that may be out of service.
The algorithm will skip these stations when its deciding on a path to take.

The show selected button only shows the list of stations selected to be out of service.

The submit button on the right prints the path from to be taken from the start location to 
the destination.
Also, it prints out the time it would take to complete the path.
